# JavaScript Koans – the good bits #

Based on Edgecase's fantastic 
[Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans), the goal of the
JavaScript koans is to teach you JavaScript programming through
testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the
JavaScript language and functional programming in general.

Your journey towards JavaScript enlightenment starts in the **app/koans/AboutExpects.js** file. 
These koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more JavaScript syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.

### Running the Koans from console

In the root folder of downloaded repository run `npm install` – than `grunt server`.

Grunt server will open your browser with address [127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000/)

The first error will be in **app/koans/AboutExpects.js**. Fix it and enjoy
with automatically refresh page. If you see green light – you can go forward
otherwise – fix current test.

The test runner used is [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) with a
customized report viewer.
